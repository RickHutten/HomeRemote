You'll need to install the following packages to run the application:
```
apt-get install mpg123
```

The following commands will install the necessary python packages:
```
pip install mutagen
pip install flask
```
... and you're done. If you want to type less each time you run a python file than do this:
```
chmod +x run.py
chmod +x refreshlib.py
chmod +x tageditor.py
```
Then run the file by: 
```
./run.py
./refreshlib.py
./tageditor.py
```
